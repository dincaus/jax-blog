conda create -n nlp python=3.10
conda activate nlp
```

After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebooks

Navigate to the NLP/ directory and start Jupyter Lab:
    
```bash
cd NLP/
jupyter lab
```
This will open the Jupyter Lab interface in your browser, where you can explore and execute the notebooks.

or Jupyter Notebook:
